The file structure for both printing the murphi ast and transforming the roc3 ast to murphi ast follows the structure of the section of the target murphi file. The target murphi file has the sections constants, types, variables, common functions, machine functions, rules and invariants, in that order (this skeleton is heavilly based on the Protocol Framework from http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~bgold/teaching/coherence.html). We have one file for each such section for both printing and translating the ast plus some helper files.
Note that the files for invariants are incomplete, and no murphi code is printed for the invariants section apart from comments.
